### Hi there 👋

I am Elisa Ferrara. Currently, I'm pursuing projects in robotics, perception, controls, using tools as ML and DL and exploring various aspects of these fields thanks to the ongoing Master Robotics in EPFL.
I graduated from the University of Florence as Electrical Engineer with a Bachelor's thesis focused on the analysis, simulation, and control of a UAV quadrotor prototype.


## About Me
- 🚀 Interning at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab in the Perception Group developing vision algorithm for the future Mars Helicopter.
- 👀 Worked at CVLab of EPFL designing from scratch the traditional CV coding assignment for the COmputer Vision course of Prof. Fua Pascal.
- 🚀 Worked as an Intern at Elythor: Visual Localization system in GNSS-denied environments
- 📚 Attending Robotics Master in EPFL. Mobile Robotics Path
- 🎓 Graduated from the University of Florence with a Bachelor's thesis titled "Analysis, Simulation, and Control of a UAV Quadrotor Prototype."
- 🌟 Experienced in robotics, controls, machine learning and robot-vision.
- 🚀 Passionate about UAVs and their flight endurance challenge
